# Image Processing Project
Project Description
This project involves developing software that can automatically read a color pattern image from a hard disk and return an array representing the color pattern. The task is inspired by Lego's "Life of George" game, where players reconstruct shapes from memory and then photograph them for comparison. This concept is extended to various image processing applications, such as color segmentation of real-world objects and reading color data matrices.


Image Loading and Processing:

Developed the loadImage function to load images from a file.
Implemented findCircles to detect and return coordinates of black circles in the images.
Created correctImage to undistort images based on circle coordinates.
Implemented getColours to extract and return color patterns from images.
Function Integration:

Integrated all helper functions into the main findColours function.
Ensured the findColours function processes images correctly and returns accurate color arrays.
Performance Evaluation:

Tested the software on the provided image set.
Documented the percentage of correctly solved images.
Discussed potential challenges with real photographs and proposed solutions.
